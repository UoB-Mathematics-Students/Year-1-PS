\section*{Preface}
This is a shared collection of notes for \modulename. Please visit \\
\repolink to find out more, and to see other modules. You can contribute to this document by:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Editing the \LaTeX{} document you wish to contribute to, then submit a pull request to \repolink.
	\item Creating a new chapter, placing the \LaTeX{} file in the \verb|tex| folder, and adding a line to \verb|Notes.tex| such as \verb|\input{./tex/MY_CHAPTER.tex}|
\end{itemize}
%
Here are some points to follow:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For the purposes of version control, please try to put each sentence on a new line. (\LaTeX{} treats a single new line as a space, so inserting these extra spaces won't affect the display of your document).
	\item Place any package imports in \verb|Notes.sty|.
	\item If you wish to contribute, try to make fairly small changes, and then submit a pull request.
	\item Use hyphens instead of spaces in your file names, e.g. \verb|My-File.tex| instead of \verb|My File.tex|
	\item Follow the current naming convention for files/chapters. For example, if the current file names are \verb|1-Alpha|, \verb|2-Beta|, then you should name your file \verb|n-FILENAME|.
\end{itemize}
